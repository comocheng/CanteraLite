# CanteraLite Direct-C
A revamp for Cantera Matlab Toolbox

This project aims to build a Cantera Matlab Toolbox with modern object-oriented programming structures. 

This Toolbox fully replicates the functionalities of the legacy Cantera Matlab Toolbox. The MEX interface is replaced with directly calls of functions within the Cantera shared library using the _calllib_ command in Matlab.
